A) Types of Software
1. Software is a computer program that tells computer hardware how to operate. Software is even more diverse than hardware—there are thousands and thousands of software programs out there. Software ranges from the Windows XP operating system that manages your computer, to the word processor you use to print letters, to the Web browser you use to surf the Internet. Software is often divided into two categories:
 - Systems software controls the basic functions of a computer, e.g. operating system, programming software and utility programs. 
 - Application software lets the user do the specific tasks such as writing letters, playing games and browsing the Internet. 

B) Operating System
2. An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory, processes, and all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.
3. Your computer's operating system manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are many different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your computer's CPU, memory, and storage. The operating system coordinates all of these to make sure each program gets what it needs. 
 
C) Types of Operating System
4. Operating systems usually come preloaded on any computer you buy. Most people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems. The three most common operating systems for personal computers are as follows:
5. Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980s. Over the years, there have been many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are Windows 10 (released in 2015), Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009), and Windows Vista (2007). Windows comes preloaded on most new PCs, which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.
6. Mac OS is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes preloaded on all new Macintosh computers, or Macs. All of the recent versions are known as OS X (pronounced O-S Ten), and the specific versions include Yosemite (released in 2014), Mavericks (2013), Mountain Lion (2012), Lion (2011), and Snow Leopard (2009). Apple also offers a version called Mac OS X Server, which is designed to be run on servers.
7. Linux is a family of open-source operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions- or versions- you can choose from. Each distribution has a different look and feel, and the most popular ones include Ubuntu, Mint, and Fedora.
