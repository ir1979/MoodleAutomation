Artificial Intelligence


 


Learning objectives: By the end of the lesson, students will be better able to … 

- identify and describe the term of artificial intelligence;
- use specific vocabulary about artificial intelligence;
- get familiar with various practical combinations used in computing;
- identify and be familiar with common punctuation and symbols in computing.

A)	The Birth of Artificial Intelligence
1. Probably many people have heard of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but relatively few people have a really good idea of what the term really means. Simply put, artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. Its goal is to enable the development of computers that are able to do things normally done by people - in particular, things associated with people acting intelligently.

2. The birth of this field, as the study of man-made computational devices and systems which can be made to act in a manner which we would be inclined to call intelligent, can be traced back to the early 1950s. Arguably, the first significant event in the history of AI was the publication of a paper entitled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" by the British Mathematician Alan Turing. In this paper, Turing argued that if a machine could pass a certain test (which has become known as the 'Turing test') then we would have grounds to say that the computer was intelligent. 

3. The Turing test involves a human being, known as the 'judge', asking questions via a computer terminal to two others, one of which is a human being and the other is a computer. If the judge regularly failed to correctly distinguish the computer from the human, then the computer was said to have passed the test. 


B)	AI Specialization
4. Artificial intelligence includes the following areas of specialization:
a)  Games playing: programming computers to play games against humans. The greatest advances in AI have occurred in the field of games playing.
b) Expert systems: programming computers to make decisions in real-life situations. For example, some expert systems help doctors diagnose diseases based on symptoms.
c) Natural language: programming computers to understand natural human languages. For example, English, French and Persian are natural languages. However, programming computers to understand natural languages has proved to be more difficult than originally thought.
d) Neural networks: systems that simulate intelligence by attempting to reproduce the types of physical connections that occur in animal brains. Neural networks are currently used mostly in voice recognition systems, image recognition systems, industrial robotics, medical imaging, data mining and aerospace applications.
e) Robotics: programming computers to see and hear and react to other sensory stimuli. Although great advances have been made in the field of robotics during the last decade and robots are now widely used in industry, medicine and also in special situations that would be dangerous for humans - for example, in cleaning toxic wastes - they are still not very useful in everyday life, as they are too clumsy to perform ordinary household jobs.
