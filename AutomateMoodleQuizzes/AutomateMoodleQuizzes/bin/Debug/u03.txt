A)	Look inside a Computer

1. Have you ever looked inside a computer case before? The small parts may look complicated, but the inside of a computer case really isn't all that mysterious. This passage will help you understand a bit more about what goes on inside a computer case. Now let’s explore the inside of a computer:

2.  CPU/ Processor: The Central Processing Unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain or heart of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start an application, you are sending instructions to the CPU. A processor's speed is measured in megahertz (MHz), or millions of instructions per second; and gigahertz (GHz), or billions of instructions per second. A faster processor can execute instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the computer depends on the speed of many different components—not just the processor.

3. Motherboard:  Your computer couldn’t work without the motherboard. It ties everything together! It allows every part of your computer to receive power and communicate with each other. Everything that runs the computer or enhances its performance is either part of the motherboard or plugs into one of its expansion slots or ports. 

4. RAM and ROM: RAM (Random Access Memory) is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed. This short-term memory disappears when the computer is turned off. If you are working on a document, you'll need to save it to avoid losing it. When you save a file, the data is written to the hard drive, which acts as long-term storage. However, ROM (Read Only Memory) is permanent and contains instructions for the computer. The BIOS (Basic Input/output System) uses ROM to control communication with peripherals, e.g. disk drives. In simple terms, the BIOS chip wakes up the computer when you turn it on and reminds it what parts it has and what they do!

5. Hard Drive: The hard drive on your computer is where the software is installed, and it's also where your documents and other files are stored. The hard drive is long-term storage, which means the data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it. When you run a program or open a file, the computer copies some of the data from the hard drive onto the RAM. When you save a file, the data is copied back to the hard drive. The faster the hard drive is, the faster your computer can start up and load programs.

6. Expansion cards: Most computers have expansion slots on the motherboard that allow you to add various types of expansion cards. Some of the most common types of expansion cards include video card (responsible for what you see on the monitor), sound card (responsible for what you hear in the speakers or headphones), network card (allowing your computer to communicate over a network and access the Internet) and Bluetooth card (allowing your computer to communicate with wireless keyboards, mice, and printers).

•	removable: capable of being removed or taken away
•	connectable: capable of being connected

I. Look at the words below. Add the suffix  -able to each one to make an adjective. Then complete the following sentences with the new words.
-	port:         			  
-	access:      			 
-	execute:    			 
-	recycle:

Hardware and software constitute a computer.
-	make up
RAM and ROM make up the main memory.
-	is a type of
Network card is a type of expansion card.
-	are parts/components of
CPU and motherboard are two main parts of a computer.
