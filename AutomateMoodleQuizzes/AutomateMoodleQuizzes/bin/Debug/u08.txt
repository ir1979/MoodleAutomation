A)	Networking Types
1. In the simplest explanation, networking is just computers talking to each other. Networking allows two or more computer systems to exchange information and share resources and peripherals. In this process, computers must also know how to find other computers on the network. To put it briefly, every computer on the network needs a unique address so messages know where to go after they are sent. Two common types of networks are LANs and WANs.

2. Local Area Network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a school, laboratory, or office building. LANs can be built with two main types of architectures:
a) peer-to-peer, where the two computers have the same capabilities;
b) client-server, where a computer acts as the server which contains the database and controls the other workstations or nodes and all the devices linked in the network. 

3. Computers in a LAN need to use the same protocol, or standard of communication. Ethernet is one of the most common protocols for LANs. A router, a device that forwards data packets, is needed to link a LAN to another network. Most networks are linked with cables or wires but new Wi-Fi technologies allow the creation of WLANs, where cables or wires are replaced by radio waves.

4. Wide Area Network (WAN) is a telecommunication network or computer network that extends over a large geographical distance. It may connect computers or LANs on opposite sides of the world. Such computers are usually linked through telephone lines, fiber-optic cables or satellites. The main transmission paths within a WAN are high-speed lines called backbones. 
B)	Network Topology
5. Network topology refers to the shape of a network and how different nodes in a network are connected to each other and how they communicate. Three common basic physical ones include:
- Star: All nodes are directly connected to a common central computer. Every workstation is indirectly connected to every other through the central computer. In some star networks, the central computer can also operate as a workstation.
- Ring: All of the computers are connected to one another in a circle. The data passes from one computer to the next one and then all the way around the ring shape until it reaches the destination computer.
- Bus: All nodes are directly connected to a main cable or link called a bus.

6. There are also mixed topologies.  With a mixed network topology, all systems are connected in a non-standard way so that the connection pattern can be classed as a 'mix' between two topology types. For instance, a star-ring topology pattern is an example of a mixed topology network. The network connections combine features of both the star topology pattern and the ring topology pattern.

Vocabulary Skill
The Prefix anti- 
This common prefix in English means against or in opposition:
•	anti-virus: produced and used to protect the main memory of a computer against infection by a virus.

•	anti-theft: used to describe equipment that is invented to prevent something from stealing.

I. 	Look at the words below. Add the prefix anti- to each one. Then complete the following sentences with the new words.
-	crack:

Writing Hints
Parallel structure
In a sentence with a conjunction such as and, or, but, the words or phrases before and after the conjunction must have the same part of speech. This creates parallel structure in the sentence.
 The virus destroyed the system and deleted all files. 
  Mobile phones can be cheap or expensive.
  Many kids like playing online games and downloading them for free.
 The typist works carefully but slowly. 
 Please change or correct the name of the folder.


Cloze
J. Complete the passage by filling in the blanks with the words in the box.
full/occurs/node/connected/organized

In a mesh network, devices are ……..…. with many redundant interconnections between network nodes. In a true mesh topology every ………. has a connection to every other node in the network. There are two types of mesh topologies: (a) Full mesh topology …………. when every node has a circuit, connecting it to every other node in the network. (b) Partial mesh topology in which some nodes are ……... in a ……... mesh scheme but others are only connected to one or two in the network.
