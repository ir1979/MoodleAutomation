A)	Parts of a Computer
1. A computer is an electronic machine that accepts, processes, stores and outputs information. Information given to the computer is called data. Two basic components make up a computer: hardware and software. You simply can’t have one without the other. All electronic or mechanical parts that you can see or touch are called hardware. Hardware includes the computer’s monitor, case, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc. 

2. Computer programs that tell hardware how and what to do are called software. You don’t have to know how to program a computer to use one. A computer programmer has already done the work for you by writing the program. All you have to do is tell the software what you are trying to do, and the software then directs the work of the hardware.

3. There are three basic hardware parts. The first part is CPU (Central Processing Unit). It is the computer’s brain or heart, a microprocessor chip which processes data and coordinates the activities of all the other units. The second part is main memory. It holds the instructions and data which are being processed by the CPU. This part has two main sections: RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory). 

4. The third part is known as peripherals. They are the physical units which are attached to the computer. They consist of:

a)	Input devices, which let the user enter data and commands (for example, the keyboard and the mouse)
b)	Output devices, which let the user extract the results (for example, the monitor and the printer)
c)	Storage devices, which let the user store information (for example, the hard disk or the DVD drive).

B)	Functions of a Computer
5. The main functions of a typical computer can be classified as follows:
a) Input: Raw data is presented to the computer via a keyboard, a webcam, etc. 
b) Processing: Data is transformed into useful information according to program instructions. It includes functions like calculating, sorting, drawing, editing and searching.
c) Storage/ Memory: Data and programs are kept in memory systems where they are available for processing or use. 
d) Output: Results take the form of words, pictures and sounds. They are the results of data processing.

Vocabulary Skill
The suffix –er / -or
Suffix is a letter or group of letters attached to the end of a word. –er /-or as a common suffix is used both for persons and things.
-	It is used for a person who does an activity, e.g. 
•	programmer is a person whose job is to produce computer programs.
-	It is also used for things that do a particular job, e.g. 
•	processor is a part of a computer that processes the information.

I. Look at the words below. Add the suffix -er / -or to each one to make a noun. Then complete the following sentences with the new words.
-	compute:  		
-	adapt:     		    
-	scan:           		
-	speak:         		
-	engine:       		
-	print:         		  
1.	A software …….. is responsible for developing, testing and evaluating the software that makes our computers work.
2. Today, bar code ……… are found in many supermarkets.
3. Using laser ……… is more time-saving and economical than inkjet ones.
4. Connecting the equipment to this electrical supply needs a/n …….
Natural English
Collocations
A collocation is two or more words that often go together. Using them makes our English sound natural. For example, in computing, we say “connect to the Internet”, not “attach to the Internet”.
verb + noun
It is a common type of collocation. Some examples are as follows:
- Please help me install the software on my computer.
- He attached a printer to his computer.
J. Choose the best verb.
1.	To turn on the computer, …… the “Start” button.
a)	switch                     b) play                  c) press
2.	Switch off your computer, then …… it from the socket.
a) plug                          b) unplug            c) take
3.	First …… the file, then send it.
a)	attach                      b) enclose            c) fasten
4.	The printer has ……. of ink.
           a) finished                  b) ended               c) run out

   4. move	d) a program
Writing Hints
  	Classifying from Whole to Parts (1)
We classify things by putting them into groups or classes. For example, parts of a computer, types of software, etc. Some typical expressions are as following:
-	include  
Hardware includes the computer’s monitor, case, printer and so on.
-	consist of
Peripherals consist of input, output and storage devices.
-	is composed of
A computer system is composed of hardware and software.
-	is made up of
A hard disk is made up of several disks.
-	comprise
Storage devices comprise CDs and DVDs.
Cloze
L. Complete the passage by filling in the blanks with the words in the box.
	results / output / data / takes / storing 

A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it ….. in raw information or ….. at one end, stores it until it is ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the …… at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, …… information is better known as memory or storage, chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called ….. .
