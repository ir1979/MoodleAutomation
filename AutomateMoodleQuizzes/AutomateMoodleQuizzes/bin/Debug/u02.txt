- get familiar with various practical combinations used in computing;
- identify and use common verbs and expressions of classifying (whole to parts).

A)	Input Devices
1. A computer would be useless if you had no way to communicate with it. That’s why you need an input device. Essentially, an input device is any piece of hardware which allows you to enter information into the computer. To put it simply, it lets you talk to your computer. Two common examples of input devices are the keyboard and the mouse. 

2.  The keyboard is probably the most used input device. It operates a lot like a typewriter, but has many additional keys that let it do special things a typewriter can’t. A typical keyboard has various groups of keys as follows:
a) Alphanumeric keys: They represent letters and numbers, arranged as on a typewriter.
b) Function keys: Most computer keyboards have between 10 and 12 function keys. These keys are usually located at the top of the keyboard and give the computer user fast ways to give the computer special instructions. 
c) Numeric keypad keys: On the right side of the keyboard there is a set of keys grouped together in a square. These keys have two functions: entering numbers and editing. The Num Lock is used to switch from numbers to editing functions.
d) Cursor keys: They include “arrow keys”, which move your computer’s cursor across the screen and keys such as Home, End, Page Up and Page Down, which let you move around documents.
e) Dedicated keys:  They are used to issue commands or produce alternative characters. They include Ctrl, Caps Lock, Enter and Backspace.

3. Mouse is another input device. It is called a mouse because of its shape and the way the cable attaching it to the computer looks a bit like a tail. Like other computer components, mice come in several shapes and sizes. Today, optical and wireless mice have substituted for rollerball mouse.
B)	Output Devices
4.  Any device that lets the computer talk to you such as the monitor, speaker or printer is called an output device. A Monitor, commonly called as a Visual Display Unit (VDU), is the main output device of a computer. It forms images from tiny dots, called pixels that are arranged in a rectangular form. The resolution of the image depends upon the number of pixels.

5.  Another output device is printer. Once you have created something on the computer, you can send it to the printer. The printer prints exactly what’s on the screen. The output on paper is called printout or hard copy. There are many different types of printers available. Ink-Jet and laser printers are the most common printer types.

6. Some computer devices can be categorized as both an input device and an output device. For example, a multifunction printer has a scanner (input) and a printer (output). Touch screen monitors are another example of an input/output device; they display images (output) and also let users interact with the computer by pressing areas of the screen (input).
