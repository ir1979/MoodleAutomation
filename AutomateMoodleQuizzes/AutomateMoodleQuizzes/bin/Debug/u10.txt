A)	Introduction
1. The Internet provides a wealth of information and services. Many activities in our daily lives now rely on the Internet, including various forms of communication, shopping, financial services, entertainment and many others. With over 300,000 new web threats created every day, the use of the Internet, presents certain risks. For the most part, the Internet is indeed private and secure, but there are a number of serious security risks. This passage will review some of those security risks and provide some practical suggestions on how to address them.
B)	Types of Security Risks
2.  Viruses: One of the most serious threats consists of viruses and other harmful programs. A computer virus is a computer program that causes damage to a computer's software, hardware or data. Once a virus is present on a computer, it typically performs some type of harmful action, such as corrupting data or obtaining sensitive information. The best way to deal with the threat of a computer virus is to use antivirus software. Antivirus software helps to protect a computer system from viruses and other harmful programs. 
3. Spyware: It is a program installed on your computer that sends information about you and how you use your computer to a third party, typically without you being aware this is happening. Spyware often enters your system when you install some type of free software from an untrusted source. Installation of the program you were interested in also installs the spyware. Once the spyware program is installed, it starts collecting information. Once the spyware has collected its information, it sends this to whoever created the program. Again, this happens without you noticing it. Removing the spyware can be difficult - often the program installs itself again as quickly as you can delete it. To counter spyware, you need to use a dedicated spyware management tool. 
4. Phishing scams: Phishing is an email scam that is disguised as an official communication from a legitimate website. The message tricks people into providing sensitive information, such as their login details. A typical scam consists of a message that describes some issue with your account and requires you to login to your account to confirm something. The message looks very official, using logos and formal language. Don't follow the link. If you are seriously concerned, go to the institution's official website and log in to your account the way you normally would. Never log in to your account from a link sent to you in an email. 
5. Spam: Spam consists of electronic junk mail. These are unwanted ones sent out to hundreds of thousands of Internet users, typically to buy something, to make a phony investment or to sign up for some type of online service. Spammers collect email addresses using automated spiders that crawl across web pages. Spiders also look through newsgroups and discussion forums. Spamming has become part of the Internet, just as junk mail has become part of the postal system. Antispam software has been developed to filter out the spam before it gets to your inbox. Antispam software uses a number of different strategies. Most email systems redirect spam into a special spam or junk mail folder. When you have a junk mail folder, you may want to check that everything in the folder is indeed spam. If you come across a particular email that should not have ended up in the spam folder, you can flag that particular email so that future messages from that sender are not considered spam.
