Programming Languages
	

 


Learning objectives: By the end of the lesson, students will be better able to … 

- identify and describe types of programming languages;
- use specific vocabulary and definitions about programming languages;
- get familiar with common compounds used in computing;
- identify and use common structures expressing contrast.

A)	What is a Programming Language?
1. What is a programming language? What are high-level and low-level languages? How can you know which one to learn first? How do you know which ones are the best for your IT field of choice? This passage attempts to cover these questions in brief.

2. A programming language is a special language that programmers use to develop applications, scripts, or other set of instructions for computers to do a specific task. This set of commands or instructions are also known as a computer language.

3. Programming languages are classified into low-level and high-level languages. Low-level languages include assembly and machine languages. These two languages are called low-level languages because they are closer to the hardware. An assembly language contains a list of basic instructions and is much more difficult to read than a high-level language. Machine language or machine code, consisting of 0s and 1s known as binary codes, is the only language that a PC can directly execute.

4. High-level languages, which are closer to human languages, are designed to be easy to read and understand. This allows programmers to write source code in a natural fashion, using logical words and symbols. For example, words like function, while, if, and else are used in most major programming languages. Symbols like <, >, ==, and != are common operators. 


B)	Top Most Popular Programming Languages

5. There are hundreds of programming languages in use today. Examples of high-level languages include C, C++, Java, Perl, Visual Basic, and PHP. Their main functions are as follows:
- C: used to write system software, graphics and commercial programs;
- C++: used to create a wide array of applications from games to office suites;
- Perl: used for text processing and system administration scripting;
- Visual Basic: used for creating Windows applications;
- PHP: used for scripting web applications;
- Java: designed and used to run on the web.


6.  Among these languages Java is the number one programming language today for many reasons. First, it is a well-organized language with a strong library of reusable software components. Second, programs written in Java can run on many different computer architectures and operating systems. Third, Java is the language most likely to be taught in university computer science classes. A lot of computer science theory books written in the past decade use Java in the code examples. So learning Java syntax is a good idea even if you never actually code in it.

Writing Hints
Expressing contrast
One way to express contrast in English is using but/ (al)though/while:
-	but:
Chinese smart phones are cheap, but they are really non-durable.
-	Although:
Although Chinese smart phones are cheap, they are really non-durable.
-	While:
While Chinese smart phones are cheap, they are really non-durable.

•	although and though mean exactly the same and are used the same, but though is more informal and more common when talking, and although is more formal and more common when writing.
•	though may be emphasized by putting "even" before: even though
•	(al)though/while and but cannot go together.
