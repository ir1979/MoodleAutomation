A)	What is Computer Ergonomics?
Many people spend a large part of their day in front of a computer screen – whether it’s a desktop computer, a laptop, tablet or even a smart phone. These days, in fact, it’s rare to find a working environment where computer screens aren’t used. This type of computer users physically stress their bodies daily without realizing it by extending their wrists, sitting without foot support and straining to look at monitors. This can lead to disorders or stress injuries, which create a life-long impact on health. Symptoms may include pain, muscle fatigue, and reduced performance. Ergonomics is a field of study that attempts to reduce strain, fatigue, and injuries by improving product design and workspace arrangement. The goal is a comfortable, relaxed posture.
B)	Computer Related Health Problems
Aches and pains can be caused by repetitive work, uncomfortable working postures, incorrect screen settings and doing tasks for long periods without suitable rest breaks. Take a look at the following tips to help improve your posture when working at your computer:
1) Upper and Lower Back Pain
When sat in your desk chair, your spine should be in an upright position. Avoid slouching down into your chair or leaning forward onto the desk, as this can cause strains, aches and pains. Your lower back should be supported by the chair or a cushion so that sitting doesn’t feel uncomfortable or unnatural.
Also, keep your neck straight as much as possible. Your eyes should be level with the area of your computer screen that is 2-3″ below the top. If you have a laptop, use a stand to raise it up. If you ever have to angle your head upwards or downwards to see the screen, then tension can happen in your neck and cause headaches and fatigue.


2) Strain in Legs and Feet
Your desk chair should be positioned so that you can sit comfortably with your feet on the floor and your lower legs vertical. Use a footrest underneath your desk if you need more support, or if the chair is putting pressure on your thighs. Make sure that there’s enough space to change position and stretch your legs out every now and then, too.
3) Eye Strain and Headaches
Prolonged use of a screen can cause visual fatigue and eye strain, so it’s important to look after your eye health. To reduce the risks of visual problems:
•	Reposition the screen to avoid glare from lights or windows.
•	Keep the screen clean and use a desk lamp to make it easier to see.
•	Ensure the screen colors are easy to look at, and that the characters are sharp.
•	Look away from the screen into the distance for a few moments to relax your eyes; focus on sth 30 meters away for 30 seconds every 30 minutes.
4) Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)
There should be enough room in front of your keyboard to support both your forearms and your wrists on the desk. Push your computer screen and your keyboard back a bit if necessary. This desk support helps prevent your arms from becoming tired or painful. When typing, keep your wrists straight. If you have to bend your wrists upwards to reach the keyboard then use a wrist support, otherwise you are at risk from a repetitive strain injury.
C)	Things to remember
Working at a computer can cause back, neck and shoulder pains, headache, eyestrain and overuse injuries of the arms and hands. You can help avoid computer-related injuries with proper furniture, better posture and good working habits.
Parents should put time limits on their children’s computer use and video-game playing. You should take regular breaks from using a computer and should do some physical activities each day.

Writing Hints
Sentences in English often have more than one clause. The following sentence has a when clause and a main clause.
When a computer begins to run a program, it is loaded into the main memory.
                         when clause                                              main clause

The when clause and the main clause can also be in the reverse order. In that case, there is no comma between the two clauses.

A program is loaded into the main memory when a computer begins to run it.
               main clause                                                         when clause
