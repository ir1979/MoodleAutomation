Data Science

 


Learning objectives: By the end of the lesson, students will be better able to … 

- understand and describe the concept of Data Science.
- give examples of different sorts of data products and their advantages.
- recognize different skills of a data scientist and how to achieve them.
- describe the goals of data science in different aspects.
A)	What is Data Science?
1. Data science is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured. Interdisciplinary means combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity. Data science involves unifying statistics, data analysis, machine learning and other related knowledge in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena. It uses several techniques and theories from many different fields such as mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. Today, many universities offer data science degree but there is no widespread agreement on the content and definition of data science courses of study among the experts.

2. Data science these days has become an extremely popular term in business and academic studies. Many companies use it to make smarter business decisions and raise the quality of their products or services and increase profits. Here are some examples:
Netflix uses movie viewing patterns of its subscribers to understand what drives user interest, and uses that to produce better programs.
Target identifies the unique shopping behaviors of customers, which helps to provide more products that match their interests and increase the selling rate of the company. 
B)	Who is a data scientist?
3. Experts in data science are called data scientists and they are somehow similar to detectives. They investigate leads and try to understand pattern or characteristics within the data. This requires a big amount of analytical creativity. Data scientists play a central role in developing data product. This involves building out algorithms, as well as testing, refinement, and technical deployment into production systems. In this sense, data scientists serve as technical developers, building assets that can be used at wide scale. But what is a data product?

4. A "data product" is a technical asset that utilizes data as input, and processes that data to return results that are generated by algorithms. The best example of a data product is a recommendation engine, which analyzes user data, and makes personalized recommendations for them based on that data. Here are some examples of data products:
- Amazon's recommendation engines suggest items for you to buy, determined by their algorithms. Netflix recommends movies to you. Spotify recommends music to you.
- Gmail's spam filter is data product – an algorithm behind the scenes processes incoming mail and determines if a message is junk or not.
- Computer vision used for self-driving cars is also data product – machine learning algorithms are able to recognize traffic lights, other cars on the road, etc.

5. Being a data scientist requires three major skills:
Mathematic Expertise: at the heart of data insight and building data products is the ability to view data from a measurable aspect. There are textures, dimensions, and correlations in data that can be expressed mathematically solutions to many business problems involve building analytic models based on in the hard math, where being able to understand the mechanics of those models is key to success in building them. Many assume that data science is all about knowing statistics but many other fields like linear algebra play an important role in it. 
Technology: Because data scientists utilize technology in order to handle huge data sets and work with complex algorithms, and it requires tools far more sophisticated than simple programs like Excel. Data scientists need to be able to code — prototype quick solutions, as well as integrate with complex data systems. Core languages associated with data science include SQL, Python, R, and SAS. On the periphery are Java, Scala, Julia, and others. But it is not just knowing language fundamentals. A data scientist should be able to creatively navigate their way through technical challenges in order to make their code work.
Business Intelligence: It is important for a data scientist to be a tactical business expert. Working so closely with data, data scientists must learn from data in ways no one else can, that creates the responsibility to translate observations to shared knowledge, and provide strategies on how to solve core business problems. Having this business knowledge is just as important as having expertise for technology and mathematics. Using Data Science clearly means effort to use different types of data in order to reach business goals. Ultimately, the value doesn't come from data, math, and technology itself. It comes from using all of the above to have strong business influence.
