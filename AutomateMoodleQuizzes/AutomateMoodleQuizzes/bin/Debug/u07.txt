	The Cloud
 

Learning objectives: By the end of the lesson students, will be better able to … 

- identify and describe the concept of cloud;
- use specific vocabulary, explanations and definitions about cloud;
- get familiar with various practical combinations used in computing;
- identify and use two common two-part conjunctions.

A)	What is the Cloud?
1.	You may have heard people using terms like the cloud, cloud computing, or cloud storage. But what exactly is the cloud? Basically, the cloud is the Internet—more specifically, it's all of the things you can access remotely over the Internet. When something is in the cloud, it means it is stored on servers on the Internet instead of on your computer. It lets you access your calendar, email, files, and more from any computer that has an Internet connection.

2.	If you have ever used web-based email, you have used the cloud. All of the emails in your inbox are stored on servers. However, there are many other services that use the cloud in different ways. Here are just a few examples:
- Dropbox is a cloud storage service that lets you easily store and share files with others, and it lets you access your files from a mobile device as well.
- Evernote lets you type notes, clip webpages, take photos, and organize all of them from your computer or mobile device.
- Mozy and Carbonite can automatically back up your data in case your computer is lost, stolen, or damaged.
3. There are also apps you can use that live in the cloud so you can use them without installing them on your computer. These apps are sometimes called web apps. Web apps include things like Google Docs, which allows you to create documents and spreadsheets online; and Runescape, which is a game you can play in your browser without downloading anything.

4. Many of the most popular sites on the Internet are actually web apps. You may have even used a web app without realizing it! Online email services like Gmail and Yahoo! Mail are two popular examples. They run within your browser and can do many of the same things email programs like Microsoft Outlook can do. After you sign up for an online email service, you can begin using it immediately—no installation is required. Instead of being stored on your computer, your emails are stored in the cloud.
B)	Why Use the Cloud?
5. There are many reasons to use the cloud, but the main reasons are convenience and reliability. Saving a file to the cloud ensures that you'll be able to access it with any computer that has an Internet connection, so you won't need to worry about using CD-ROMs or USB flash drives. The cloud also makes it much easier to share a file with coworkers and friends.
6. With the cloud, you're much less likely to lose your data because it is stored on servers. However, just like anything online, there is always a risk that someone may try to gain access to your personal data, so it's important to choose a strong password and pay attention to any privacy settings for the service you're using.
